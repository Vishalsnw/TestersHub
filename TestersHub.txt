Create a complete Android mobile application using Kotlin named TestersHub.
This app helps Android developers exchange Google Play closed testing support.
The project must be a native Android app, not a web app.
Use:
Kotlin
XML layouts
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Firestore (real-time updates)
The UI must be clean, modern, and mobile-first.

Authentication
Implement Google Sign-In using Firebase Authentication.
After login, store user profile in Firestore collection:
users/{userId}
name
email
profilePhoto
helpedCount = 0
requestedCount = 0

Main Screen — Public Testing Requests Feed
Create MainActivity that shows a RecyclerView list of testing requests where:
status == "IN_PROGRESS"
Each card must show:
App Name
joinedCount / testersRequired
Deadline
Button: Join Testing
Button: View Details
Use Firestore addSnapshotListener for real-time updates.

Create Testing Request Screen
Create CreateRequestActivity with form fields:
App Name (EditText)
Package Name
Testing Link
Testers Required (number input)
Deadline (Date Picker)
Instructions (multiline)
On submit: Create Firestore document in:
testingRequests/{requestId}
Fields:
appName
packageName
testingLink
testersRequired
joinedCount = 0
deadline (timestamp)
instructions
createdBy (currentUserId)
status = "IN_PROGRESS"
createdAt (timestamp)
Also increase user's requestedCount by 1.

Request Detail Screen
Create RequestDetailActivity.
Show:
App Name
Package Name
Testing Link (clickable)
Instructions
Progress Bar (joinedCount / testersRequired)
RecyclerView list of supporters
Join Button (hidden if already joined)
Listen to Firestore document in real-time for progress updates.

Join Testing Logic
When user presses Join Testing:
Check if document exists: testingRequests/{requestId}/supporters/{userId}
If not exists:
Add supporter document with timestamp
Increase joinedCount using FieldValue.increment(1)
Increase current user’s helpedCount by 1
If joinedCount >= testersRequired: Update status = "COMPLETED"

My Requests Screen
Create screen showing:
Requests created by user
Requests user has joined
👤 Profile Screen
Show:
Profile photo
Name
Helped count
Requested count
Logout button

Notifications (Basic)
When someone joins a user's request: Store a notification document:
notifications/{userId}/items/{notificationId}
message
requestId
timestamp
read = false

Firestore Structure Summary
users/{userId}
testingRequests/{requestId}
testingRequests/{requestId}/supporters/{userId}
notifications/{userId}/items/{notificationId}

UI Requirements
Use Material Design
Use RecyclerView for lists
Use ProgressBar for tester progress
Use CardView for request items
Bottom Navigation with:
Home
Create
My Requests
Profile

Additional Requirements
Prevent duplicate joins
Real-time UI updates
Clean architecture with Activities and Adapters separated
Comment the code properly
Generate full Android Studio project structure with activities, XML layouts, adapters, data models, and Firebase integration code.
